# UML Diagrams
We created some UML Diagrams for better understanding.

## Activity Diagram 
The Activity Diagram illustrates the flow of user interactions within the BarrelSnap application. 
It begins with the user launching the app and determining whether they are a registered user. 
Based on this, they either log in or register. After authentication, users select their role, leading them to specific pages tailored to either clients (consumers) or managers (winery owners). 
Clients can explore and purchase wines, while managers can manage their wineries and add products. Finally, the user's interaction with the app concludes.
